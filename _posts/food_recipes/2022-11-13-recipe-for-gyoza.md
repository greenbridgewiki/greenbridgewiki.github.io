Recipe for Gyoza [UNTESTED]
========================

# Ingredients

## Wrapping Dough

## Filling
 - 1.5-2 pounds ground meat (I use pork or chicken most of the time that I grind myself)
 - 1 medium head of napa cabbage, finely chopped (you can also sub about 2c kimchi drain and chopped)
 - 1 large bunch of scallions, chopped
 - 3T fresh grated ginger (I like extra ginger in mine because it's good for your digestion, but that's up to you)
 - 4T minced or grated fresh garlic (can substitute roasted garlic, but double the amount. I like garlic, okay?)
 - 6-8T soy sauce
 - 2T sesame oil
 - 1T Gochujang (optional for spicier gyoza)
 - 1-2T salt
 - 1t MSG (optional, but does make a difference)

## Dipping Sauce

 - Soy sauce
 - Sugar
 - Sesame oil
 - Chili oil
 - Black vinegar (optional)

# Steps

 1. Shred
 2. Fry
 3. Boil
 4. Serve


Add the chopped cabbage to a colander or strainer, and toss in about 6T salt. This help draw moisture out the dumplings, so they don't explode out of their wrappers from steam when you are cooking them. Set aside.
Add the rest of the ingredients to a larger mixing bowl, and stir together, always stirring in one direction either clockwise or counterclockwise. This will make the dumpling feeling stay together more, and be more tender because the way the fat is emulsified as you are stirring. Feel free to use your hands, that's what I do.
Once the cabbage has been sitting for about 15 minutes, squeeze the excess moisture out of it, and add to the pork mixture. Stir it in the same direction that you had been stirring previously.
At this point I like to try the filling and see how it tastes, and if it needs more seasoning, more salt etc... 
Take a small amount of the filling, and fry it in a pan, taste it, and see if it needs anything added. If not, we can start stuffing the dumpling wrappers.
Like I said above, I use pre-made frozen, dumpling wrappers from my local Asian market. Feel free to use fresh dough, it does make a difference, and I will do that when I'm making small batches of special dumplings. But it just takes too much time when I'm making 300-400 gyoza.
If you're using frozen wrappers like I do, make sure you take them out and let them thaw first, then put them on a plate under some damp paper towels so they don't dry out. Get a little bowl of water, because you'll need it to seal the wrappers. Stuff each wrapper with about 1 to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of filling each, making sure not to overfill them. Then dip your fingers in water and moisten the outside edges of the wrapper, then crimp them shut. You can find dumpling folding / wrapping videos on YouTube, I recommend watching one if you've never done it before. It's really simple though, and once you get to dumpling #20 or so you'll start getting into the swing and be able to do it on autopilot.
There are many different ways to cook them, you can steam them, you can boil them, you can pan sear steam them, you can deep fry them. Generally up to you. You just want to make sure you cook them for 7 to 8 minutes from frozen, to be sure the filling is cooked through before you eat them.

For the dipping sauce just kinda mix everything together in proportions that you like? It's very off the cuff. Mostly soy, a pinch of sugar, a few spoonfuls of the oils and black vinegar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.

And there you have my basic gyoza recipe. You can customize it basically however you want, add kimchi, use different meats, use bok choy instead of napa. The list goes on. It can be a lot of work, but eating fresh gyoza definitely makes up for all the trouble and time it takes initially.
