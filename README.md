**Welcome to Green Bridge Wiki**

# Overarching incentive

This project is driven by the idea that overcoming the environmental challenges that humanity faces, requires incorporating sustainability into mainstream cultures. On this website, we keep note of and share some of our daily efforts to live more sustainably. We like to think these changes at the individual and family level (sometimes a wider sphere of influence when friends join in), can spark a process that leads to further-reaching, systemic change. Green Bridge stands for the union of these bottom-up and top-down changes as much as for 'the other' metaphorical bridge linking 'today' to a potential future in which we, 'humans', can live within the Earth’s limits again.

# About the content

For us, learning to live more sustainably in a world dominated by unsustainable systems, is hardly done overnight and is an open-end process. To avoid feeling overwhelmed and/or fall into the consumption trap of buying your way to a more environmentaly-friedly lifestyle without questioning underlying values, adopting more sustainable practices is best done, at least at the begining: slowly — one step at a time. 

Eventhough we dream of a radically changing the systems which we use and that serve us daily, so far our circumstances have permitted us to change some practices within some areas of our lives. The content of this website, revolves around the most important areas in which we've managed to stick to those changes, which generally involve rethinking what we consume, how we consume, what we dispose off and how.
