**Welcome to Green Bridge Wiki**

# Fuel & objective

This project is driven by the idea that overcoming the environmental challenges that humanity faces, requires incorporating sustainability into mainstream cultures. Through this website, we support each other along the open-end learning process of trying to live more sustainably and we keep ourselves accountable for taking note of the efforts we make. 

We like to think that these changes at the personal and family level (sometimes a wider sphere of action when friends and neighbours join in), can spark a process that leads to further-reaching systemic change by nurturing ways of being that have broad social and political repercussions. 

Green Bridge stands for the union of these bottom-up and top-down changes as much as for 'the other' metaphorical bridge linking 'today' to a potential future in which we, namely humans, can live within the Earthâ€™s limits again.
