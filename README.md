# Main incentive

This project is driven by the idea that overcoming the environmental challenges that humanity faces, requires incorporating sustainability into mainstream cultures. Through this website, we keep ourselves accountable of taking note of the efforst we make live more sustainably, and we get to share them with you. We like to think these changes at the individual and family level (sometimes a wider sphere of influence when friends join in), can spark a process that leads to further-reaching, systemic change. Green Bridge stands for the union of these bottom-up and top-down changes as much as for 'the other' metaphorical bridge linking 'today' to a potential future in which we, namely humans, can live within the Earthâ€™s limits again.
