**Welcome to Green Bridge Wiki**

# Overarching incentive

This project is driven by the idea that overcoming the environmental challenges that humanity faces, requires incorporating sustainability into mainstream cultures. On this website, we keep note of and share some of our daily efforts to live more sustainably. We like to think these changes at the individual and family level (sometimes a wider sphere of influence when friends join in), can spark a process that leads to further-reaching, systemic change. Green Bridge stands for the union of these bottom-up and top-down changes as much as for 'the other' metaphorical bridge linking 'today' to a potential future in which we, 'humans', can live within the Earthâ€™s limits again.
